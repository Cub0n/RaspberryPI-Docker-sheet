# Motivation
RaspberryPI is a small computer for expermimants (hard- and software) and is able to provide and execute an environment for containers (PaaS).
The goal is to have an optimized and leightweight setup for a PaaS.
It begins on operating system level and goes till the image itself.

**This is an ongoing work and is not yet finished!!**

# <a id="os">Operating systems</a>
The operating system should be leightweight: No GUI ("headless"), no multimedia stuff, no "fat" applications or services. A good overview is [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/lightweight-operating-systems-raspberry-pi/).

# <a id="config">Configuration for OS'es</a>
## Raspbian / Debian / DietPI
* Activate cgroup support in kernel

# <a id="paas">PaaS</a>
## Runtime Plattforms
### Docker
### k3s / k3d
### minikube
### podman
### nerdctl

## Rootless Container
