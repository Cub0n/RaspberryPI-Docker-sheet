# Motivation
RaspberryPI is a small computer for expermimants (hard- and software) and is able to provide and execute an environment for containers (PaaS).
The goal is to have an optimized and leightweight setup for a PaaS.
It begins on operating system level and goes till the image itself.

**This is an ongoing work and is not yet finished!!**

# Topics
* Operating systems for RaspberryPi
* Configuration and Tweaks
* PaaS Tools
* Images and Container

# Operating systems
The operating system should be leightweight: No GUI ("headless"), no multimedia stuff, no "fat" applications or services. A good overview is [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/lightweight-operating-systems-raspberry-pi/).

# Configuration 

# PaaS Tools
* Docker
* k3s / k3d
* minikube
* podman
* nerdctl
